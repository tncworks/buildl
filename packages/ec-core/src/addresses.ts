// The deployed contract addresses the SDK needs, per network.
//
// These are bundled rather than pulled from `@somnia-chain/deployments`: that
// package is not installable outside the somnia-markets monorepo (it is marked
// private, and its `src` imports the JSON manifests through paths that escape
// the package, so a published copy cannot resolve them). Bundling keeps this kit
// installable from a plain `npm install`.
//
// Verified against smart-contracts/deployments/<chainId>/ on 2026-07-24.
// The protocol core is CREATE3-deterministic, so it is identical on both
// networks; only `marketCreator` and the collateral token differ.
//
// To refresh: read the addresses.json for the network in the somnia-markets repo
// (or the table in its DEPLOYMENTS.md) and update the map below. Any single
// address can also be overridden from .env without editing this file — see
// `ADDRESS_OVERRIDES` in config.ts. `npm run ec:doctor` verifies the module address
// actually has code on-chain, so a stale entry fails loudly.
